				<img class="img img-responsive img-rounded" id="about-johnpic" src="images/DePaulStudioPic.JPG">
				<p id="lead">I am currently a junior at DePaul University, studying Sound Recording Technology with a minor in Physics.</p>
				<p>During my three years at DePaul, I’ve been working in our studios at least once or twice a week, in order to gain hands on experience with all of the equipment available to me. In addition to working on my own electronic project, I’ve recorded a handful of my own rock-influenced music as well. As a vocalist at DePaul, I have also had the opportunity to record some very talented Opera vocalists. I’ve been working very hard at expanding my portfolio to include projects and genres that may be more accurate to the work I will be doing after school. With this goal in mind, I’ve gone out of my way to work with classmates that are studying cinematography as well. Although our program focuses on the application of recording techniques to music, I have been scoring and editing audio for short films outside of school. This has created an interesting challenge because I am forced to use my music editing skills within the score, as well as come up with other editing techniques to achieve various sounds within the mix of the entire film.</p>

					<p>Last summer I was fortunate enough to gain some real world experience at Chicago Recording Company (CRC). CRC is an independent recording studio responsible for recording many well known projects such as Wilco’s Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, R.Kelly’s I Believe I Can Fly, Lady Gaga’s Artpop, and many more. At CRC, I had the opportunity to sit in on recording sessions with a handful of experienced engineers such as Steve Weeder, Danny Leake, and Jeff Lane. This experience allowed me to observe the techniques these engineers used in their efforts to produce a quality product. Aside from their technical decisions, I was also able to observe the social interactions between the engineers and their clients. I noticed how the engineers and producers communicated with the performers in order to achieve their goal in mind.</p>
					<img class="img img-responsive img-rounded" id="about-johnpic" src="images/CRCSSLphot.JPG">
					<p>I am proficient at using Protools 11, Logic Pro X, and Final Cut Pro. I am very passionate about the music I work with and I am always striving to get a better sound than the last project. While I’m always working to make the next recording better, I also understand that many artists want their recordings to sound similar in order to have continuity across the entire record. Continuity is an important characteristic for engineers to keep in mind, and I am aware of its importance even as the album is becoming a less popular art form.																																																																																																</p>
